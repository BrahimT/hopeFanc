    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>We love Jesus</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">It's my joy to welcome you to Hope For All Nations Church here in Ottawa, the capital city of Canada. Here, the living unchanging Word of God is proclaimed with clarity and simplicity in the spirit of love. Our mandate is to transform ordinary men and women through the gospel of Jesus Christ by making them true disciples and maturing them into the image of our savior Jesus Christ.One of the most assuring promises in the Bible is found in Jeremiah 29:11-12, where the spirit of the Lord declares through the prophet Jeremiah “For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you” In this particular context, our God is referring to His ability to provide certainty, a guarantee and hope for a better future through freedom from the slavery and power of sin, not only to those who trust in Him, but to those who call on His name out of a pure heart. Recent events in our communities, Nations and world at large have left many in great despair with feelings of enormous uncertainty and numerous questions.In an era where governments can no longer guarantee the peace, security, and well-being of their peoples, the ideas, values and institutions that held society together and provided some degree of certainty and security are falling short; ideologies, philosophies and theories are being revisited and revised yet with seemingly no guarantee. In the midst of such chaos, confusion, despair and hopelessness, we have a hope for our world; an assurance for the future. Romans 15:13 declares “May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.” Our Hope is in Jesus Christ, and the freedom he has brought through his sacrificial death, burial and resurrection. Find hope by trusting in Him today.You are invited to join Hope for All Nations Church each Sunday afternoon as we grow in the grace of God. Please let us be a part of your Christian growth and development

    <h2 class="w3-wide">What is the purpose of this application ?</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">There are hundreds of thousands of phone apps available for download. The fact is, your church attendees are already heavily dependent on their mobile devices to stay connected to their most valuable information and entertainment. The question is, don’t you want your church to be just as valued as what keeps them glued to their devices?
        Here are some reasons your church should consider a custom church mobile app :</br>
        </br>
        1. Communicate to your target audience more effectively</br>
        2. Increase giving opportunities</br>
        3. Create some excitement within your church</br>
        4. One, simple place to keep sermon and teaching resources</br>
        5. Get volunteers to actually respond to you</br>
        </br>
        church apps are no longer only beneficial for big churches with big budgets. If your small or medium-sized church has ever considered an app, don’t wait any longer. You have too much to lose and so much to gain. After all, the real point of church technology has never been to save money or increase donations, even though those are nice side effects.


        The real point of church technology is to improve faith formation.
